# **EXPEDITOO Project Overview**

**Version: 2025 — 1.0.0**

---

# 1. **General Objective**

EXPEDITOO is a unified digital platform combining:

- **Auction operations** (listing, bidding, purchasing)
- **Direct online sales**
- **Peer-to-peer and operator-based logistics (Cocolis-like)**
- **Secure payments via Stripe**
- **Real-time messaging between buyers and sellers**
- **Document and photo exchange**
- **Geolocation-based item discovery via map**
- **Automated notifications via WhatsApp or SMS** *(Deferred to V2 - using Email for V1)*

This document defines the **final high-level architecture** using:

- **Next.js (Frontend + Backend)**
- **REST API** (100% implemented - 105+ endpoints)
- **React Server Components (RSC)** for SSR
- **Client Components + TanStack Query** (Integrated for data fetching with caching)
- **Feature-driven architecture (React Bulletproof)**
- **Service Layer + DAL + DTO** (Clean Architecture implemented)
- **Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL** (14+ schemas implemented)
- **Better-auth** (Authentication integrated)
- **Stripe Integration** (Checkout elements, Payment Intents, Webhooks, and Refunds fully implemented)
- **Ably Realtime** (Chat & Notifications implemented)
- **Map provider integration (MapLibre + OSM)** (UI integrated with CartoCDN tiles, Nominatim geocoding, OSRM routing)

Microservices are intentionally avoided. Everything lives in a **single scalable Next.js monorepo**.

2.  **Review**: Admin reviews application in Admin Dashboard -> "Driver Applications".
3.  **Approval**: Admin approves application -> User role updates to `DRIVER`.
4.  **Driver Panel**: Approved driver gains access to `/driver` dashboard.
5.  **Proposals**:
    - Driver views available shipments.
    - Driver submits **Proposal** (price/time) for a shipment.
    - Admin/Operator selects the best proposal.
    - Shipment assigned to Driver.
6.  **Driver Dashboard**:
    - **Active Shipments**: Overview of ongoing deliveries.
    - **My Shipments**: History with status filters (Waiting, Approved, Active, Done).

# 8. **Summary**

EXPEDITOO is built as a unified Next.js monolith with:

- Clean domain-driven structure
- Strong separation between UI → API → Service → DAL
- Full integration with Stripe, maps, WhatsApp/SMS, and real-time messaging
- Support for auctions, logistics, payments, chat, and operators
- Feature-complete UI with progressive backend implementation
- A scalable foundation that can evolve into microservices in the future.

This architecture is production-ready and supports fast MVP delivery while maintaining long-term scalability. The chat feature demonstrates our approach: build complete, production-quality UI first, then progressively enhance with backend services as needed.
